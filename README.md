Simple React high order function to expose when the component is being hovered.

## Usage

Let's build an example react component:

```js
const Header = ({ style }) => (<h1 style={style}>Header</h1>)
```

And decorate:

```js
import WithHover from 'react-with-hover'

const Decorated = WithHover()(Header)
```

Now when you use `<Decorated />` it will pass a boolean property `hover`.

You can change the property name by passing a function, example:

```js
const Decorated = WithHover(
  { transform: (flag) => ({ mouseOver: flag }) }
)(Header)
```

The property passed to the `Header` would change to `mouseOver`

You can also change the wrapper div style to meet your needs like:

```js
const Decorated = WithHover(
  { containerStyle: { display: 'inline-block' } }
)(Header)
```
